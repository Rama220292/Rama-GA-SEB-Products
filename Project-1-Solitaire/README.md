# Project Brief
---
## Overview
This is my first project during the Software Engineering Bootcamp. There is 3.5 day timeline to develop the product from start to finish, and is being developed using JS, HTML and CSS. I landed on the basic version of Solitaire aka Klondike. This was a game I was familiar with, that has some complexity, and would enhance my development in software engineering.

Day 2: AM - HTML. PM - Functions 
Day 3: AM - Functions. PM - DOMs

## Use of LLMs
My focus for the first project is to hone my software development skills, and spend less time on design. And to develop good grounding in SWE, my plan is to avoid using LLMs as a baseline, and only when I face significant roadblocks which I cannot overcome after troubleshooting. So the main use of AI for me are (1) to trouble shoot my code when I face errors which I cannot solve and (2) develop the CSS style for the game. I will use Claude Code, since it is widely being used by peers/friends and Microsoft Co-Pilot, since I have a paid version from my work.
